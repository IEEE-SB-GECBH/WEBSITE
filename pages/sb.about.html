                  strengths. As each year passes, the SB catches the attention of students, by showcasing the spirit and
                  determination of every volunteer, and every member who contributes to the development of the SB. As
                  time progresses, the value of this SB has exponentially increased, creating a stunning image, amongst
                  others in the IEEE Kerala Section. It has always and continues to produce quality workshops, talks and
                  industrial visits, staying true to mottos of the technical organization. It’s a pleasure to see the
                  members of the SB extending support to those who require technical assistance. I am proud to be the
                  counselor of this student branch."</p>

                <p id="job">Chairman</p>
                <p id="info">"IEEE, as you know, is the world&#8217;s largest technical professional organisation. But
                  it wasn&#8217;t just that for me. IEEE was like my family during college days &amp; has played a major
                  role in shaping up my personality. I can surely say that my life wouldn&#8217;t have been the same, if
                  not for this beautiful family that I got at GEC Barton Hill. The beauty of IEEE is the spirit of
                  volunteering shown by its members. The platform that IEEE provides is the same for both you and me.
                  But how much you utilize its potential for your professional growth is what that determines whether
                  your $27 was worth or not. As evident from my own case, IEEE is an organisation that values
                  one&#8217;s dedication &amp; contributions to the development of the organisation. From starting the
                  journey as a member of the SB to serve as its Chairman, I feel privileged to have played a small part
                  in its legacy. I would like to thank my seniors at IEEE &#8211; Ajay Wilson, Rohini Madhav, Ashwin P,
                  Rafi SM &amp; others for the inspirational role they played in the journey of fellow members of my
                  batch. It is they who made us join the organisation in the first place. Personally, I would like to
                  express my gratitude to Birenjith sir, Josna ma&#8217;am &amp; Anu Mohamed Sir &#8211; one of the best
                  faculty combo who have been with the ExCom throughout these years. All this was possible due to the
                  sheer dedication &amp; commitment of the IEEE Executive Committee, I&#8217;m just speaking on their
                  behalf. It&#8217;s the wish of all the final year IEEE members that this vibrance must continue &amp;
                  our SB attain greater heights in the future. Au revoir &amp; prosperity to my IEEE Fam!"</p>
